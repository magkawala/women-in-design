        <p>"My work is play. And I play when I design. I even looked it up in the dictionary, to make sure that I actually do that, and the definition of 'play,' number one, was 'engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor,' and number two was 'gambling.' And I realize I do both when I'm designing"
